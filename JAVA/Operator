What will be the output of the following Java code?

    class increment {
        public static void main(String args[]) 
        {        
             int g = 3;
             System.out.print(++g * 8);
        } 
    }
a) 32
b) 33
c) 24
d) 25


Answer: a
Explanation: Operator ++ has more preference than *, thus g becomes 4 and when multiplied by 8 gives 32.
