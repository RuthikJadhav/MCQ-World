d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The main function of a command interpreter is to get and execute the next user-specified command. Command Interpreter checks for valid command and then runs that command else it will throw an error.

4. To access the services of the operating system, the interface is provided by the ___________
a) Library
b) System calls
c) Assembly instructions
d) API
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: To access services of the Operating System an interface is provided by the System Calls. Generally, these are functions written in C and C++. Open, Close, Read, Write are some of most prominently used system calls.
5. CPU scheduling is the basis of ___________
a) multiprogramming operating systems
b) larger memory sized systems
c) multiprocessor systems

6. Which one of the following is not true?
a) kernel remains in the memory during the entire computer session
b) kernel is made of various modules which can not be loaded in running operating system
c) kernel is the first part of the operating system to load into memory during booting
d) kernel is the program that constitutes the central core of the operating system
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Kernel is the first program that is loaded in memory when OS is loading as well as it remains in memory till OS is running. Kernel is the core part of the OS which is responsible for managing resources, allowing multiple processes to use the resources and provide services to various processes. Kernel modules can be loaded and unloaded in run-time i.e. in running OS.
7. Which one of the following errors will be handle by the operating system?
a) lack of paper in printer
b) connection failure in the network
c) power failure
d) all of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: All the mentioned errors are handled by OS. The OS is continuously monitoring all of its resources. Also, the OS is constantly detecting and correcting errors.
8. Where is the operating system placed in the memory?
a) either low or high memory (depending on the location of interrupt vector)
b) in the low memory
c) in the high memory
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: None.
9. If a process fails, most operating system write the error information to a ______
a) new file
b) another running process
c) log file
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: If a process fails, most operating systems write the error information to a log file. Log file is examined by the debugger, to find out what is the actual cause of that particular problem. Log file is useful for system programmers for correcting errors.
10. Which one of the following is not a real time operating system?
a) RTLinux
b) Palm OS
c) QNX
d) VxWorks
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: VxWorks, QNX & RTLinux are real-time operating systems. Palm OS is a mobile operating system. Palm OS is developed for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).
11. What does OS X has?
a) monolithic kernel with modules
b) microkernel
c) monolithic kernel
d) hybrid kernel
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: OS X has a hybrid kernel. Hybrid kernel is a combination of two different kernels. OS X is developed by Apple and originally it is known as Mac OS X.
12. In operating system, each process has its own __________
a) open files
b) pending alarms, signals, and signal handlers
c) address space and global variables
d) all of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: In Operating Systems, each process has its own address space which contains code, data, stack, and heap segments or sections. Each process also has a list of files that is opened by the process as well as all pending alarms, signals, and various signal handlers.
13. In a timeshare operating system, when the time slot assigned to a process is completed, the process switches from the current state to?
a) Suspended state
b) Terminated state
c) Ready state
d) Blocked state
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In a time-sharing operating system, when the time slot given to a process is completed, the process goes from the running state to the Ready State. In a time-sharing operating system, unit time is defined for sharing CPU, it is called a time quantum or time slice. If a process takes less than 1 time quantum, then the process itself releases the CPU.
14. Cascading termination refers to the termination of all child processes if the parent process terminates ______
a) Normally or abnormally
b) Abnormally
c) Normally
d) None of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Cascading termination refers to the termination of all child processes if the parent process terminates Normally or Abnormally. Some systems don’t allow child processes to exist if the parent process has terminated. Cascading termination is normally initiated by the operating system.
15. When a process is in a “Blocked” state waiting for some I/O service. When the service is completed, it goes to the __________
a) Terminated state
b) Suspended state
c) Running state
d) Ready state
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Suppose that a process is in “Blocked” state waiting for some I/O service. When the service is completed, it goes to the ready state. Process never goes directly to the running state from the waiting state. Only processes which are in ready state go to the running state whenever CPU allocated by operating system.
